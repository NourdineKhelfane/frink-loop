  <strong>Smart autonomous coding loop that orchestrates Claude Code using OpenAI or Anthropic as the reasoning agent.</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Frink Loop takes your task, breaks it into subtasks, and executes them through Claude Code with persistent sessions and dynamic task management. The orchestrating AI decides when to continue, reset context, or adapt its approach.
